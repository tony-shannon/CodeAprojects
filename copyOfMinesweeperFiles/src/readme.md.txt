These files need compiling from
src to lib folder

this is done via
npm run build

the instructions to run game.js are found inline text

ie

// To play Minesweeper, we will create instances of MineSweeperGame in command line.
// For example:
// In the command line, navigate to the lib directory and run `node`
// Run `.load game.js` to load the contents of this file.
// Then create a Game instance and run commands like so:
// let game = new Game(3, 3, 3);
// game.playMove(0, 1);
// game.playMove(1, 2);
// When done run `.exit`
